# co op submarine management game
The year is 65 Million BC and the dinosaure empire is about to go extint,
You are in a bloody war agaist the impirialist empire from the west
Fight till your last breath with your fellow comrade on the last remaining "USS Rawr" (AKA USSR)

# jobs
	1. Repair      - gets a ui screen divided into 3 areas, one is water leaks, needs to spam click the holes, one is pressure valve needs to spin
					and the third is stabilizing shields by correcting a few sliding bars.

	2. Upgrade     - typing game, the more you type the longer the words get, see xp bar. looks like a hacking terminal. divided into a few
					lines, one for intel gathering distance increase, one for better shields and one for better weapons. and timer to stop spamming.
					so the player on the top floor will have down time for pacing.

	3. Navigation  - go to the front of the submarine and open map, press to create path. grid.

	4. Sonar       - gets angle and distance. red dot is enemy and yellow dot to resurface and get fuel. and has the fuel
					timer to make players play fast and aggressive.

	5. Weapons     - shoots in angle and distance. for angle turn a red wheel ship navigation angle + sonar angle.

	6. Reloader    - grab a missile and walk slowly to the reloading station to place it down

# map
	The sub is a 2d side view 2 floor with an automatic elevator in the middle.
	the idea is to devide the 3 tasks (navigation, shooting and maintenance) between the two players
	top floor = upgrade in the back, weapon in the middle and navigation on the front.
	bottom floor = repair in the back, reloader in the middle and sonar on the front.

# audio
	sound effect for things like sonar, hacking typing and level ups, being hit, just water sounds and more.
	music for in fight and chill.
